## Who

I am a Data Scientist with 5+ years of experience, highly skilled in machine learning, optimization and creative thinking.
I have worked in both startup and corporate environments creating machine learning tools.
I have also been a research scientist and have a strong mathematical and algorithmic background.
				

## I love writing
I love writing because I like to communicate with people. I write to express myself and my ideas. I write to understand technical topics: writing makes me see things in a clearer way. <br />I write because I love what I do.
				
## And I love travelling

As Pico Iyer said “We travel, initially, to lose ourselves; and we travel, next to find ourselves. We travel to open our hearts and eyes and learn more about the world than our newspapers will accommodate. We travel to bring what little we can, in our ignorance and knowledge, to those parts of the globe whose riches are differently dispersed. And we travel, in essence, to become young fools again- to slow time down and get taken in, and fall in love once more.”
