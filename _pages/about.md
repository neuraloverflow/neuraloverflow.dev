Hey 👋 I'm Jacopo!
	
I'm a data scientist with 5+ years of experience [highly skilled](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacopoparvizi)  in machine learning, optimization and creative thinking.

I write this blog because I love what I do.
I write to understand technical topics: writing makes me see things in a clearer way. 
I write to express myself and my ideas.
I love writing because I like to communicate with people.

In my free time I travel around the world with my wife. We travel to open our hearts and eyes and learn more about the world than our newspapers will accommodate. We travel to bring what little we can, in our ignorance and knowledge, to those parts of the globe whose riches are differently dispersed. And we travel, in essence, to become young fools again to slow time down and get taken in, and fall in love once more.

> “We travel, initially, to lose ourselves; and we travel, next to find ourselves. - Pico Iyer”

I also [make music](https://soundcloud.com/jacopoparvizi) and art.

Now I'm using the plank-ez. 

Here is my layout:
