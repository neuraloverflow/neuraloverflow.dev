    I love writing because I like to communicate with people. I write to express myself and my ideas. I write to understand technical topics: writing makes me see things in a clearer way. I write because I love what I do.

	In my free time I travel around the world with my wife. As Pico Iyer said ‚ÄúWe travel, initially, to lose ourselves; and we travel, next to find ourselves. We travel to open our hearts and eyes and learn more about the world than our newspapers will accommodate. We travel to bring what little we can, in our ignorance and knowledge, to those parts of the globe whose riches are differently dispersed. And we travel, in essence, to become young fools again- to slow time down and get taken in, and fall in love once more.‚Äù
